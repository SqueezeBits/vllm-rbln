# NOTE(RBLN): This patch originated from
# https://github.com/RBLN-SW/vllm-rbln/pull/159 with commits
# https://github.com/RBLN-SW/vllm-rbln/commit/bb256b7 and
# https://github.com/RBLN-SW/vllm-rbln/commit/1f7d2bd while adding mixed
# precision quantization support.
# This patch must be applied before creating model config because vLLM imports
# the mixed precision kernel chooser while building model config.
