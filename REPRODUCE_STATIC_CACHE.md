With the use of the `mark_static_address` API in `CompileContext`, it seems that the KV cache values remain in the device memory and are shared between different processes. 

- code A(execution1, 3): scheduling multiple prefill requests in a chunk is implemented
- code B(execution2): original code (schedule only 1 prefill request at a time)

As shown in Execution1 below, the current implementation of this branch does not properly write KV caches of multiple prefill requests in a chunk. This issue can be reproduced whenever the this code is run on a new device. However, once the proper code B is executed (Execution2; with `DISABLE_MULTIPLE_PREFILLS=1`), the previously incorrect code then produces the same results as the proper code(Execution3).

I am wondering if this is a known issue or intended behavior. I believe different processes should have isolated virtual memory addresses and static-marked device memory should be cleaned up after the process terminates if `mark_static_address` is intended to retain the address.

It can be reproduced with the environment described below. In the newest version, this modification results in a kernel-side error, so the issue cannot be detected.
