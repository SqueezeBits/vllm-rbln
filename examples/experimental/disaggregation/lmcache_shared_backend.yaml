# Shared-backend sample for strict LMCache disaggregation smoke on RBLN.
# This enables a filesystem-backed cache path that is visible across processes.
#
# NOTE:
# - Use a deterministic hash function for cross-process cache-key stability.
# - Keep PYTHONHASHSEED fixed (for example 0) across producer/consumer
#   launches for distributed/disaggregated runs.
# - Depending on LMCache version/runtime, additional backend tuning may be
#   required to observe non-zero hit tokens.
